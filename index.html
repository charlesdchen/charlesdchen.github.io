							<h1>Hi, I'm Charlie</h1>
							<p class="major">I'm a PhD candidate in <a href="https://engineering.wustl.edu/academics/programs/imaging-science/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imaging Science</a> at Washington University in St. Louis. I study imaging techniques like MRI, which are powerful tools for analyzing the human brain. However, they cannot truly resolve microsopic tissue structures of interest. My <a href="#projects">work</a> compares imaging results with microscopy findings to better understand what MRI and other imaging techniques are measuring in the brain.</p>
							<p class="major">Outside of research, I enjoy playing <a href="#music">music</a> and answering <a href="#questions">questions</a> that pop into my head and don't go away, among other things.</p>
							<p class="major">Here's my <a href="#contact">contact info</a> if you want to get in touch.</p>

							<h2>Amyloid-&beta;</h2>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/amyloid.jpg" alt="" /></span>Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) is used for identifying the presence of amyloid-&beta; in the brain. However, PiB PET cannot distinguish diffuse and cored/compact plaques, which are two sources of amyloid-&beta; in Alzheimer disease (AD). Here we compared <em>in vivo</em> PiB PET with follow-up stereology of amyloid-&beta; plaques in individuals with typical AD and those with a rare dominantly inherited form of AD (DIAD). We found that the PiB PET correlates with diffuse plaque burden in DIAD and with both diffuse and cored/compact plaque burdens in typical AD.

							<h2>Tau</h2>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/tau.jpg" alt="" /></span>Flortaucipir positron emission tomography (PET) is used for identifying the presence of tau in the brain. However, flortaucipir PET cannot distinguish neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and neuropil threads, which are three sources of tau in Alzheimer disease (AD). Here we compared <em>in vivo</em> flortaucipir PET in individuals with typical AD and those with a rare dominantly inherited form of AD (DIAD) with stereology of tau burden in a different cohort. We found that flortaucipir PET reflects total tau burden in both typical AD and DIAD, composed mainly of neurofibrillary tangle and neuropil thread burdens.

							<h2>Myelin</h2>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/myelin.jpg" alt="" /></span>Diffusion MRI and probablistic tractography are powerful tools for analyzing long-distance connections within the myelinated white matter of the brain. However, there is a tendency for tractography streamlines to terminate preferentially at gyral crowns versus sulcal banks and fundi, resulting in a folding-related bias in apparent connectivity. Here we characterize this gyral bias by comparing diffusion MRI fiber orientations with axonal trajectories estimated from myelin-stained histology sections. We found that in sulcal banks and fundi, fibers crossing the gray/white boundary were less heavily myelinated than at gyral crowns, resulting in less accurate diffusion MRI fiber estimates.

							<p>I didn't record most of my performances at all, which is a shame, and the ones that were recorded weren't done with any professional equipment, which is also a shame, but I suppose having some recorded is better than nothing.</p>

							<p>I tried matching the music with some art from painters of roughly the same era and nationality and artistic style as the composers, at least to the extent we can compare styles in art with those in music.</p>

							<p>I remember reading <em>What are the Seven Wonders of the World?</em> by Mary Desmond Pinkowish and Peter D'Epiro a lot when I was in elementary school. It was the most comprehensive source of cultural knowledge I had at the time. It also instilled in me a fondness for the Q&A format.</p>

							<p>I also remember reading a few books from the <em>Imponderables</em> series by David Feldman. I suppose that instilled in me a fondness for superficially inane questions.</p>

							<p>All this to say, if you're wondering why I've titled my essays and side projects in the form of a question, one or more of the books above are to blame.</p>

							<h2>What happened on this day in US history?</h2>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/mb-w.jpg" alt="" /></span><a href="calendar.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This</a> is my attempt at filling a calendar with important events from US history. I thought it could make for a fun way to learn a little bit about US history over time. I've tried to get an even sampling of various kinds of history, not just military. Still, this is a work in progress, the choice of events to highlight remains very subjective, and inevitably there will be several important events missing, and several movements or eras that cannot easily be distilled into one watershed moment with a known date and time. The calendar is based on <a href="https://codepen.io/dudleystorey/pen/MagNaY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> design by Dudley Storey, and I've added some code to handle the differently-sized photos coming from external sites.

							<h2>What do "Grade A" stickers mean on restaurants?</h2>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/sticker.jpg" alt="" /></span><a href="https://github.com/charliedchen/stl-restaurants/blob/main/notebook.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This</a> is my attempt at figuring out what those "Grade A" stickers mean on restaurants in St. Louis. Chances are, if you've eaten out at any point in your life, you might have noticed these "Grade A" signs taped near the restaurant door. In my memory, every restaurant I've gone to in St. Louis has a "Grade A" rating from the St. Louis Department of Health. Naturally, I was curious to see whether there were any restaurants with a rating lower than "A". To answer this question, I ended up writing a Python script to scrape and compile St. Louis restaurant health inspection records into a more easily parsable format.
